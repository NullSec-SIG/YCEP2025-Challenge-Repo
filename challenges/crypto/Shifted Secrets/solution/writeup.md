# Shifted Secrets
In the text file, you are given the text, `LPRC25{E0G4G10ANY_Z0I1AT}`  
From the question, we are able to deduce that its a **ROT cipher**, which can be easily bruteforced. For this example, we shall use **Cyberchef**.  
In Cyberchef, place the ROT13 Recipe, and you get the flag, `YCEP25{R0T4T10NAL_M0V1NG}`
