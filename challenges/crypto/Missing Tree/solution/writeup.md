# Mysterious Morse
You are given a PNG file containing a torn section of a Morse code binary search tree, as well as the encoded flag text
The encoded flag text is written in 'T's and 'E's, which represent the elementary Morse code values of dashes (-) and dots (.).
To solve, you will have to substitute each 'T' and 'E' with its respective elementary values and use a online Morse decoder to obtain the flag, YCEP25{B1NARY-TR3E}.
