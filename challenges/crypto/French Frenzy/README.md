# French Frenzy
Oh no! My French pen pal accidentally encrypted the contents of a few top-secret files, and things took an acidic turn! Now his boss is as sour as vinegar. He only possesses the encryption script and one of those encrypted files, can you help him before the situations becomes even more corrosive?
