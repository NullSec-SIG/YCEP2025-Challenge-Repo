# Help Me!
It was a busy week at work, and unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to visit the mall I had planned to check out during my stay at that country. I was told it's one of the most popular malls, though I can't quite remember the name. I only remember itâ€™s being within 20 minutes from the airport I was at. Can you help me find it?

The airport code and mall name should all be in lowercase.

FLAG FORMAT: YCEP25{<CODE OF THE AIRPORT>_<MALLNAME>}
