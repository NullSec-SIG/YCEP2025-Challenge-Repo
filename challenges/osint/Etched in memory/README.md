# Etched in memory
A few months back, I stumbled upon this amazing dining place in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. It had cozy vibes, delicious food, and the best part? They had live music playing in the background. It wasn't just any background music though, there was this incredible musician performing, and the music just set the perfect mood.

All I can recall is that this place was recommended by someone who goes by the username 'michrods' online. She's all about food, tourism and lifestyle. If you follow the trail, I bet you'll hear the music again. Oh, and did I mention that this happened on Christmas? Do keep that in mind!

I also remember something about the musician planning to release a single -  but the name escapes me. Let me know if you can find the musician and their latest single, I still can't get their music out of my head!
