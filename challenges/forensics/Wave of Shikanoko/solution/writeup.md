# Wave of Shikanoko

This is an Audio Forensics challenge whereby the description implies a Least Significant Bit algorithm has been applied to the wav file

Solve script
```py
import wave
song = wave.open("flag.wav", mode='rb')

frame_bytes = bytearray(list(song.readframes(song.getnframes())))

# Extract the LSB of each byte
extracted = [frame_bytes[i] & 1 for i in range(len(frame_bytes))]
# Convert byte array back to string
string = "".join(chr(int("".join(map(str,extracted[i:i+8])),2)) for i in range(0,len(extracted),8))
# Cut off at the filler characters
decoded = string.split("###")[0]

# Print the extracted text
print("Sucessfully decoded: "+decoded)
song.close()
```
