description = "Alice, Bob and Charlie have had ENOUGH with being used as examples when explaining cryptographic algorithms by the cybersecurity community. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, RSA, AES, DES - they're sick of hearing that kind of nonsense. \n\nTherefore, according to our intelligence agencies, they are plotting a massive revenge cyberattack against Windows computers around the world - the scale of which would, at least in their plans, have a MUCH larger scale than the WannaCry ransomware or the CrowdStrike Falcon BSOD incident. Special Operations Forces from our cybersecurity agency have just received and conducted a no-knock warrant against Alice and seized her computer.\n\nOur teams have created an .ad1 image of her computer's hard drive and briefly looked through it. We know Alice has been making the malware on Visual Studio, but it seems like our SOF wasn't in time before she deleted everything in her Documents folder where the code was most likely stored and left a less than kind note on it for us. Also, Alice most likely would've been sharing files back and forth with Bob and Charlie, so there must be evidence of that somewhere.\n\nCan you help us recover whatever you can? We need to stop this terror attack before it starts."
