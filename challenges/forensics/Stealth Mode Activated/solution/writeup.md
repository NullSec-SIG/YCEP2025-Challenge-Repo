## Stealth Mode Activated

Participants are given a disk image file `disk.image.gz`.

For this writeup, the provided solution uses TheSleuthKit (TSK) CLI approach, instead of Autopsy's GUI approach. 

![Decompression and overview of disk](./images/image1.png)

To begin, we need to decompress the gzip file. Next, run `mmls` and `fls` to have a high-level understanding of the disk contents.

Doing this will reveal 2 files that are of interest, `hidden_data.txt` and `.i_hope_this_file_stays_invisible`.

![Contents of the 2 files](./images/image2.png)

By using `icat` to display the contents of the 2 respective files, we now know that the flag is within the `bin` directory in the file system.

>[!NOTE]
>![Searching for specific strings](./images/image4.png)
>Technically, we are also able to use `srch_strings` and search for terms like "flag". This should reveal the same clue above.
>However, since the actual flag is encoded in base64, this disallows participants from searching for "YCEP25" to get the flag.

![Contents of the file system](./images/image3.png)

When we use the fls command with the -r flag to recursively display the contents of the file system, weâ€™ll see a detailed list of all items within the directories, including key system directories like bin.

Notice that the inode number for the `bin` directory is 13 (from the very first screenshot).

![Contents of the bin directory](./images/image5.png)

By specifying the inode number (13), we can display only the contents of the `bin` directory. Within this directory, we can see that this directory contains many of the common commands used in Linux CLI.

![Suspicious file](./images/image6.png)

Scrolling through the output, we can see that there's a file called "hide". This should raise suspicions as there is no such command in Linux. The description also gives a subtle hint to this, saying that it's "well hidden".

We should note down the inode number of the "hide" file (`545`).

![Acquiring the flag](./images/image7.png)

Now, using the found inode number, we can display the contents of this file. It should reveal a base64 encoded string. This can be decoded using `base64 -d` or other similar methods.

Decoded flag: `YCEP25{d15k_d15k_h1d3}`
