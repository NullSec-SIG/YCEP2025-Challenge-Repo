So the other day my friends introduced me to this little browser game called Shell Shockers and it's quite fun, except for the countless times I get absolutely DEMOLISHED by them ðŸ˜¡. I wanted to take revenge on them by downloading some cheats, so I got some exe file on the Internet that claimed to be them. But now it's making my PC BSOD every time I log in!!

Can you help me stop this damn thing from running and restore my desktop? PLEASE??? My mum will kill me to see the family PC in this state ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

To attempt this challenge, please approach one of our facilitators for the distribution files.
