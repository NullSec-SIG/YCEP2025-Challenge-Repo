I wanted to take revenge on them by downloading some cheats, so I got some exe file on the Internet that claimed to be them. But now it's making my PC BSOD every time I log in!!\n\nCan you help me stop this damn thing from running and restore my desktop? PLEASE??? My mum will kill me to see the family PC in this state ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­\n\nTo attempt this challenge, please approach one of our facilitators for the distribution files."
