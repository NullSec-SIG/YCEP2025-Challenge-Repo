description = "Ok, so we have some bad news and good news.\n\nThe bad news is that ConsumerFolder has detected your actions and patched the bug that you used to compromise them, and that they are working with the ISD to monitor you. \n\nThe good news is that I've heard from the grapevine that ConsumerFolder has recently hired some clueless intern from Y3 NP IT to help them work on this new admin portal. That admin portal will allow admins (and, well, you) to get those NRICs for free. He's an absolute rookie (to put it nicely) at Next.js but he's so proud to show off his Next.js \"skills\", that I even heard during Y1S2 he insisted on using it for his Frontend Dev project despite his groupmates not knowing a single thing about it.\n\nThis new admin portal will definitely have some serious holes in it. Try to find them!"
